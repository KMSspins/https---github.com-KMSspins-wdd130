    <h3>Kim</h3>
    <p>My name is Kim Sorensen.  I have lived in American Fork, UT, for 31 years.<br>  
    I was born in a hospital right across the street from the Idaho Falls Temple and,<br>
    21 years later, was sealed to my eternal companion, Phil, in the Idaho Falls Temple.<br>  
    We have three children, two sons, and a daughter. We have two granddaughters and I<br>
    am blessed to spend time with them each week.</p>
    <p>I enjoy hand spining, which means I own spinning wheels and use them to make yarn.<br>  
    I also love to knit, weave, dye, garden, and do family history research.</p>
    <p>I attended a boot camp last year and learned that I enjoy creating websites. <br> 
    I am excited to finish the education that I began years ago at Ricks College.<br>
    Online education works great for me so that I can still work as a customer service representative,<br>
    volunteer, care for my family, and have time to finish my degree.  My major is Applied Technology<br>
    and right now my goal is to work as a front end dev.</p>
