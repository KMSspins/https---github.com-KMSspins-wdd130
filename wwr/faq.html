                <h1>FAQ</h1>
            </div>

            <div class="questions-box">
                <h5>Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?</h5>
                <p>These trips are high-adventure, team building activities for adult teams. Please visit Dry Oar
                    Rafting for our family oriented river rafting vacation information. </p>
                <h5>Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I still come?</h5>
                <p>As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help ensure
                    your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First Aid and all start with at least 3
                    years
                    of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land.
                    <br>
                    Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears Coast Guard approved life vest or personal flotation
                    device (PFD). Many non-swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. Your guide will give
                    you an in depth and engaging safety talk before your trip begins explaining what you should
                    prepare
                    for and do in the event that you fall out of the raft.
                </p>
                <h5>What is included in the trip?</h5>
                <p>We will provide all necessary camping equipment.<br>
                    This includes a sleeping bag, a foam pad, a waterproof duffle bag, a small waterproof day bag, a
                    tent, a cot, eating utensils and a camping chair.<br>
                    Three meals per day, plus snacks are provided.<br>
                    We provide water and lemonade during the day. Coffee, tea, and hot chocolate are provided during
                    the
                    morning and evening hours.<br>
                    You may bring beer, liquor and soft drinks (in reasonable amounts, 2 cans per day).
                    You may purchase these items either the night before the trip, or on your way to the put-in.
                </p>
                <h5>What is so great about white water rafting anyway?</h5>
                <p>Are you kidding me?! What's not great about whitewater rafting!...Let's describe a common day on
                    the river.<br>
                    Arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping under a beautiful
                    starry sky.<br>
                    Have a hearty warm breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes or omelets to order, then pack
                    your things and prepare for the day.<br>
                    The day is filled with some combination of swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, history, geology,
                    stories, and more good food.<br>
                    We try to hit camp around 4 or 5. After setting up your cot you can relax with a good book or
                    good company by the river, or explore around camp while your guides prepare your
                    dinner...something
                    perhaps like steak and potatoes,
                    or grilled salmon...and dutch oven brownies...you won't forget the dutch oven brownies.<br>
                    After dinner it's more relaxing, and you might even be able to talk your guide into another
                    story or two to send you off to bed under more stars than you thought were possible.
                </p>
                <h5>How far in advance should I book my trip?</h5>
                <p>If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking a year in advance. If you can be more
                    flexible, 6 months in advance is usually sufficient.
                </p>
